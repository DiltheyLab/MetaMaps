MetaMaps requires c++11 to build, which is available in GCC >= 4.8 and 
OSX >= 10.7.

Dependencies:
-------------
   - Autoconf ( http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ )
   - Boost Library ( http://www.boost.org ) (see "-with-boost" below)
   - Zlib ( included with OS X and most Linuxes, http://www.zlib.net ) *


Steps:
------
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure --with-boost=/path/to/boost [--prefix=...] 
   make metamaps


Products:
---------
   - command line tool ( <prefix>/metamaps)

Configure options:
------------------
--prefix=</path/to/install>
  Installs binaries to bin/ and libraries to lib/ within this path. The default
  is /usr/local/, which will typically require sudo for make install. Must be
  absolute path.
--with-boost=</path/to/boost/>
  Use Boost from this location, instead of GSL. Must be absolute path and should
  not include bin/ or lib/. Will be statically linked. Be mindful of licensure
  if distributing.
  
* If Zlib is not installed in a standard system location (it usually is),
  CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS will have to be modified before making.
